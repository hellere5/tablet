          My name is Eliza Heller and I am a junior at the University of Michigan working to receive my BSI
          from the School of Information and a minor from the Ross School of Business. 
          I have always been interested in cooking and eating culturally diverse foods and wanted to share my 
          favorite recipes with you!

        <p>
          I am from Cleveland, Ohio and have lived there my whole life. I went to Gilmour Academy for High School
          and was a four year varsity ice hockey and lacrosse player. During my freetime, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and cooking.
          I would always help my mom and sister cook dinner for our family.

        <p>
          A little secret about me is that I love to travel. I have travelled the world with my family and one of my favorite things to do
          is to experiment with foods from different cultures. This is one of my favorite spots in Israel where we were able to take in the beautiful
          views of Tel Aviv while enjoying delicious appetizers and treats. Sometimes, it's the little things in life that make you happy.

        <p>
          Life is a beach and the beach certainly is better with friends! The Tel Aviv beach is the ultimate summer 
          destination and I tried not to miss a day, especially after a long day of work! And what could be better 
          than picnicking with a group of friends while watching the spectacular sunset over the Mediterranean Sea.

        <p>
          This is my family at my sister's graduation. We are extremely close and we love spending time together.
          I have 3 siblings, two of them are older and one of them is younger.

        <p>
          A fun fact about me is that I used to play ice hockey. 
          I first laced up when I was 5 years old and I didnâ€™t look back (until I graduated high school). 
          I have played all around the world including Prague, Italy, Canada and Finland and too many states to mention.
          My hockey roots run deep - my grandfather, father, uncles, five cousins and three siblings all played at competitive levels.

        <p>
          Another fun fact about me is that I was a four year varsity lacrosse player in high school.
          I was Captain my senior year and received the MVP award.
          I love being part of a team and many of my teammates will remain lifelong friends.
          I will always love being active and playing sports.
